      <h1>Scarface</h1>
      <p>
        In 1980, Cuban refugee and ex-convict Antonio "Tony" Montana arrives in
        Miami, Florida, as part of the Mariel boatlift, where he is sent to a
        refugee camp with his best friends, Manny Ribera, Angel and Chi-Chi. The
        four are released and given green cards in exchange for murdering a
        former Cuban general at the request of Miami drug dealer Frank Lopez.
        They become dishwashers in a diner, but a disgusted Tony proclaims that
        he is meant for bigger things. Frank's right-hand man, Omar Suarez,
        sends the four to purchase cocaine from Colombian dealers, but the deal
        goes bad. Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw, while Manny and Chi-Chi
        rescue Tony and kill the Colombians. Suspecting that Omar set them up,
        Tony and Manny insist on personally delivering the recovered drugs and
        money to Frank. During their meeting, Tony is attracted to Frank's
        trophy wife, Elvira Hancock. Frank hires and befriends Tony and Manny.
        Months later, Tony is reunited with his mother Georgina and younger
        sister Gina, of whom he is fiercely protective. Disgusted by his life of
        crime, Georgina throws Tony out. Manny is attracted to Gina, but Tony
        tells him to stay away from her.

        Frank sends Tony and Omar to Cochabamba to meet with cocaine kingpin
        Alejandro Sosa. Tony negotiates a deal without Frank's approval,
        angering Omar, who leaves to contact Frank. Sosa claims that Omar is a
        police informant and that Frank is weak; Tony witnesses a beaten Omar
        hanged from a helicopter. Tony vouches for Frank's organization and
        Sosa, taking a liking to Tony, agrees to the deal, but not before
        warning Tony to never betray him.

        Back in Miami, Frank is infuriated by Omar's demise and the unauthorized
        deal struck by Tony. Later, when Tony visits Elvira, she reveals that
        Tony has started his own operation, separate from Frank's. At a
        nightclub, corrupt detective Mel Bernstein attempts to extort money from
        Tony in return for police protection and information. Tony angers Frank
        further by openly pursuing Elvira in the club. Tony spots Gina and her
        drug dealer boyfriend, Fernando, making out in the men's bathroom while
        she snorts cocaine. Both of them are beaten. Hitmen attempt to
        assassinate Tony, but he escapes. Tony, certain that his boss sent both
        Bernstein and the assassins, confronts Frank, with Manny and Chi-Chi in
        tow. At gunpoint, Frank confesses to the attempted hit and begs for his
        life, but he and Bernstein are killed. Tony marries Elvira and becomes
        the distributor of Sosa's product. He builds a multimillion-dollar
        empire, living in a vast, heavily guarded estate.

        By 1983, however, Tony becomes dissatisfied with his lifestyle and
        cocaine addiction. His money launderer demands a greater percentage,
        while Manny resents Tony's growing paranoia and abusive treatment of
        Elvira. A sting by Federal agents results in Tony being charged with tax
        evasion, with an inevitable prison sentence. Sosa offers to use his
        government connections to keep a desperate Tony out of prison, but only
        if Tony assassinates a journalist intending to expose Sosa about his
        drug operations. Later, Tony, during a public dinner, accuses Manny of
        causing his arrest and Elvira of being an infertile junkie, causing
        Elvira to leave him. He travels to New York City to carry out the
        assassination with Sosa's henchman, Alberto, who plants a
        radio-controlled bomb under the journalist's car. However, the
        journalist is unexpectedly accompanied by his wife and children.
        Disgusted, Tony kills Alberto before he can detonate the bomb and
        returns to Miami.

        An enraged Sosa calls Tony to promise retribution. Tony, at his mother's
        behest, tracks down Gina. Tony finds Manny with Gina; in a fit of rage,
        Tony shoots Manny dead, after which Gina tearfully tells Tony that she
        and Manny had just got married the day before and wanted to surprise
        him. A stunned and remorseful Tony returns to his mansion, bringing Gina
        along, and begins a massive cocaine binge by himself in his office.
        While Sosa's men begin attacking the mansion, a drugged Gina appears and
        accuses Tony of wanting her for himself and attempts to kill him, but is
        slain by one of Sosa's men, who is in turn killed by Tony. With Tony's
        men all dead and assassins outside, Tony turns a grenade
        launcher-equipped M16A1 on Sosa's men, mowing down many. Tony is
        repeatedly shot by the remaining attackers, but continues to taunt them
        until he is fatally shot from behind by the shotgun-wielding assassin
        known as The Skull. His corpse falls into a fountain below, in front of
        a statue with the inscription "The World is Yours".
